To find out how this redirect works: 

<meta charset="utf-8">: This line specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. utf-8 supports all characters and symbols in Unicode.

<title>Redirecting to https://greg.heffner.live/</title>: This line sets the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=https://greg.heffner.live/">: This line is where the redirection actually happens. The http-equiv="refresh" attribute is used to refresh and redirect the page. The content attribute specifies the delay before the refresh (in this case, 0 seconds), and the URL to redirect to.

<link rel="canonical" href="https://greg.heffner.live/">: This line is used for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) purposes. It tells search engines that the canonical (the preferred version of a web page) URL is https://greg.heffner.live/. This helps prevent duplicate content issues.
